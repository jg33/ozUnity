Change List:

1.4.1:

      with a single character on the second line.
    - Library updates.
1.4.0:
    - Added missing method HyperText.GetTagKeywordCollections().

      so you can now substitute quads in for text (e.g., emoticons).
    - Added ability to match punctuation in keywords.
    - Added method signatures for IList getters that perform no/fewer
      allocations:
        - HyperText.GetLinkHitboxes()
        - HyperText.GetLinkKeywordCollections()
        - HyperTextProcessor.GetCustomTags()
        - HyperTextProcessor.GetLinkKeywordCollections()
        - HyperTextProcessor.GetLinks()
        - HyperTextProcessor.GetQuads()
        - HyperTextProcessor.GetTagKeywordCollections()

        - HyperTextStyles.GetLinkStyles()
        - HyperTextStyles.GetInheritedStyles()
        - HyperTextStyles.GetQuadStyles()
    - Changed method signatures for IList setters to take any IEnumerable<T>
      and perform no allocations unless needed to grow lists:
        - HyperText.SetLinkKeywordCollections()
        - HyperText.SetTagKeywordCollections()
        - HyperTextProcessor.SetLinkKeywordCollections()
        - HyperTextProcessor.SetTagKeywordCollections()
        - HyperTextStyles.SetLinkStyles()
        - HyperTextStyles.SetCustomTextStyles()

        - HyperTextStyles.SetQuadStyles()
    - Made some old method signatures that performed allocations obsolete.
    - Added InputTextSource property to HyperText. If assigned, the OutputText
      property of this object will be rendered on the HyperText instance.
    - Added LocalizableText asset type to demonstrate use of
      HyperText.InputTextSource. You can access it from Assets -> Create ->
      Candlelight -> Localizable Text.
    - Added default styles serializable property to HyperText. If you select
      HyperText.cs, you can set a value here that will be assigned to any new
      HyperText instance when it is first created.
    - Fixed bug causing inherited quad styles to render at the wrong size if
      the parent style sheet used a different font size.
    - Library updates.
1.3.2:
    - Plug-in now supports WinRT and Windows Phone platforms.
    - Library updates.
1.3.1:
    - Fixed bug causing run-time error on AOT platforms.
    - Fixed bug causing styles with a size scalar to display at incorrect sizes
      on scaled cavnases in Unity 4.6.5 and 5.1.0.
    - Fixed possible exception in styles editor when adding inherited styles.
    - Library updates.
1.3.0:
    - Fixed bugs in rendering non-square quads caused by 1.2.2. Behavior now
      matches that of UnityEngine.UI.Image in Simple mode with preserveAspect.
      You may have to reconfigure any quads that contained empty space.
    - Fixed text not appearing in Unity 4.6.5.
    - Fixed undo/redo of text changes not rebuilding geometry.
    - Fixed exception in editor when setting size scale of custom styles.
    - Assigning a Font to HyperText now overrides the Font assigned on its
      style sheet. You may have to remove references to default fonts (e.g.,
      Arial) on existing HyperText objects to recover old appearances.
    - Added properties to override default font face, color, and line spacing on
      HyperText.
    - HyperText styles can now inherit from one another! If a custom style is
      defined on a parent style, it can be overridden on a child style by
      redefining it. If a style sheet has several parents, the sheets at the end
      of the list have the highest priority.
    - Library updates.
    - Updated Known Issues in Readme.txt.

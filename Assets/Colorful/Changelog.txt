3.1
- New effect, "Hue Focus" to only display the colors in a given hue range and show the rest as black & white. Works great when used before a "Brightness / Contrast / Gamma" effect to give a sort of Sin City look, where only a few colors are visible and the rest is high-contrast black & white.
- Added 3 Instagram filters to the "Vintage" effect : Lark, Juno, Reyes.
- Added a "Random Activation" option to the "Glitch" effect with customizable time ranges.

- New effect, "Channel Clamper", to clamp each color channel independently to a minimum and maximum value.
- New effect, "Channel Swapper", to combine or swap color channels.
- New effect, "White Balance", to remove unrealistic color cast and shift the neutral tone of the render.
- Added a "Custom" quality mode to "Radial Blur". You can now put a custom sample count if you don't like the default presets.
- Better internal file path control. You should now be able to move the Colorful folder safely.
- General UI fixes & usability tweaks.
- Documentation fixes & additions (+ videos for animated effects).
- Removed the documentation from the package, it's now online only. Benefits : the package size is a lot smaller and imports faster.

- Fixed a bug introduced in 2.2.1 with "Lookup Filter" and "Vintage" when working in Linear mode.

- New effect, "Contrast Vignette". The old "Fast Vignette" plays on darkness and saturation, this new one focuses on darkness and contrast enhancement which results in a more photographic look.
- Added a "Center" property to "Fast Vignette" to change the center point.
- Massive optimizations to the "Hue / Saturation / Value" shader.
- The "Hue / Saturation / Value" effect now comes with an optional advanced mode. This mode is a bit slower but way more powerful as you can now work separately on reds, yellows, greens, cyans, blues and magentas (like Photoshop).
- The "Vibrance" effect now comes with an optional advanced mode which uses a different algorithm and let you tweak how channels (RGB) are affected.
- The "Levels" effect editor has been rewritten from scratch. It's now more efficient and comes with a new "Auto B&W" feature (see the doc). Its public API hasn't changed so it should be compatible with the old one.

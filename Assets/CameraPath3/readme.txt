Camera Path Animator 3.1
------------------------------------------------------
Thanks for purchasing Camera Path Animator from the Unity Asset Store (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#/content/617).
Create, edit and preview camera animations within the editor and avoid having to compile the scene to see every change.
PLEASE BACKUP PROJECTS BEFORE UPDATING.
Don't forget to leave us a review! :o) Hopefully a nice one...
NOTE: The Camera Path Animator Asset Store license is for a single user at a time. If multiple people use this, you need multiple licenses!

INSTALLATION:
------------------------------------------------------
To install Camera Path Animator simply import all files from the unitypackage.
Note that Camera Path version 2.0 and 3.0 are incompatible.
Also note that version 3.1x is not compatible with 3.0x

------------------------------------------------------
QUICKSTART:
------------------------------------------------------
Once you have installed Camera Path you should be able to see the Camera Path 3 directory in your project view.
To start creating your new animation path, click on GameObject > Create New Camera Path
This will place a new animation path in the scene with the animator and path components attached.

UPGRADING FROM 3.0x to 3.1
------------------------------------------------------
There is a readme file included called "3.1x Upgrade readme" that goes over this process.

2D Example not working correctly
------------------------------------------------------
The 2D demo requires some sorting layer settings and as this is not a Complete Project, I cannot add them myself.
Check the following image and go to Edit > Project Settings > Tags and Layers to modify them accordingly

BASIC OVERVIEW:
------------------------------------------------------
There are two components in a Camera Path object. 
The Main Camera Path which allows you to create and edit the path.
The Camera Path Animator which controls how the path behaves in your game.

In the Camera Path component we have the following modes
Path Points - these define where the path goes.
Control Points - only used in Bezier curves, these control the shape of the curves.
FOV - is used to control the Field of View of the Camera during the animation.
Speed - is used to control the speed of the animation over the curve.
Delay - you can add points to delay the animation by specific time periods.
Ease Curves - Control the ease of the animation speed at specific stop points on the animation.
Events - add events to the path that can either call functions in other objects, or broadcast events.
Orientations - Control the orientation of the camera through the path, only used in the Custom animation mode.
Tilts - control the camera tilt through the path used in follow path animation modes
